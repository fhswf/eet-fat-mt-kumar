# Master's Thesis on Online-adaptive Cluster-based Anomaly Detection

This repository provides the reproducible Python scripts for the experiments provided in the Master's Thesis named Online-adaptive Cluster-based Anomaly Detection, authored by Syamraj Purushamparambil Satheesh Kumar, as a part of the course "Systems Engineering and Engineering Management" in the Department of "Electrical Energy Engineering", supervised by Dipl.-Info. Detlef Arend.

This thesis provides two experiments: Extended Cluster-based Anomaly Detection and Network Traffic Monitoring. These experiments can be reproduced by running the scripts in the respective directories in "src/experiments."

The dataset directory contains a network traffic dataset that has been used for the second experiment. The raw network packets of the UNSW-NB 15 dataset were created by the IXIA PerfectStorm tool in the Cyber Range Lab of UNSW Canberra to generate a hybrid of real modern normal activities and synthetic contemporary attack behaviours. The following are the references to the dataset.
